            <h6>OUR GREATEST CURRENCY IS THE TIME THAT WE SAVE</h6>
            The goal that we aim to achieve is help students and faculty save time in finding and gathering useful resources by bringing them to one place here on this platform. We bring together all kinds of resources and an exclusive notice board which helps faculty members to post notices that students might find helpful and miss by chance. This venture is all about helping saving time and making interactions between students and faculty easier and smoother.
